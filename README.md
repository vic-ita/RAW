# RAW
RAW DHT - a secure Block Chain based DHT implementation

## Overview
RAW DHT protects stored <key,value> pairs from Node Insertion attacks. It is a software implementation of a novel DHT architecture described in my Ph.D. thesis "Randomness, Age, Work: Ingredients for Secure Distributed Hash Tables".

I will soon extend this readme file and fill out a basic wiki documentation.
